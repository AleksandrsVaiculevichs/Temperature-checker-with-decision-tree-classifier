# 🌡️ Temperature-checker-with-decision-tree-classifier
## 📌 Description:
This project presents a machine learning system designed to **classify types of temperature** based on real-world data using a **decision tree classifier**.

The main goal was to develop a model capable of analyzing temperature patterns and assigning them a corresponding label (e.g., *cold*, *normal*, *hot*), enabling automated classification in various contexts such as weather apps or IoT systems.

# First part:
To begin with, a dataset from Kaggle was used, which contains temperature data across different times of the day and days of the week. The temperatures were then modified using Excel formulas, and each temperature value was assigned a specific label. This helped to create an approximate balance between all classes.
